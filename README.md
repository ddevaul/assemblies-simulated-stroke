Quick README

This project is forked from https://github.com/dmitropolsky/assemblies

The main change to NEMO is in brain_alt.py in the stroke function. We also added
a function in learner.py called test_word_nums_only which is just to run test_word
but with an output specific to our purposes.

The experiments were mainly run in tests.ipynb and test_simple.ipynb. 

Apologies in advance for, naming conventions, having a lot of code that we 
didn't even end up using. It's 5 in the morning right now and I would like to
get some sleep though. Maybe I will clean up some of the notebook stuff later.

Thanks again for a great semester. You're awesome if you've read this far, by 
the way.
